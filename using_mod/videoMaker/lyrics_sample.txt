Yeah
As I started getting older, shit got so real
Hold it in the holster, kill or be killed
Moving like a soldier, mine break whole fields
Battle on the shoulder, brain [?]
Heavy Lyrics [?] light source
Still hit my [?]

The wait is over now the weight on me
Put some heads in the box like a state ID
Put some homies on the block and let them get that cheese
I got some G's full of P's, baby ready to squeeze
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, gеt it
Are you ready?
Are you rеady-ready?

I'm from the gutter
It's kill or be killed

Yeah
As I started getting older, shit got so real
Hold it in the holster, kill or be killed
Moving like a soldier, [?]
Battle on the shoulder, brain [?]
Heavy Lyrics [?] light source
Still hit my [?]

The wait is over now the weight on me
Put some heads in the box like a state ID
Put some homies on the block and let them get that cheese
I got some G's full of P's, baby ready to squeeze

Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it
Get it

I'm from the gutter
It's kill or be killed

(Kill or be killed)

(Kill or be killed)
