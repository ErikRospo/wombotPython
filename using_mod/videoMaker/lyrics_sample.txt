We put in practice and discipline, no giving up, no giving in
We're matchfit, we're here to win
For those of you that don't know Information Information
And we're getting in without an invitation
Sound travels and the ground shakes
And our society got us on the wild chase
Tell 'em it we'll be back in sixty seconds with the loud bass
We're moving at our pace
