Run for cover
Bombs are falling
Skies are burning
Time is running
I feel you drowning
I see you drowning
You're slipping away
It's getting cold out
It's time to go now
Far away from here
Yes, I miss her
She was my savior
And now the voices are calling me

Run for cover
Bombs are falling
Skies are burning
Time is running
I feel you drowning
I see you drowning
You're slipping away
It's getting cold out
It's time to go now
Far away from here
Yes, I miss her
She was my savior
And now the voices are calling me
