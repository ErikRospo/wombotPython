All I do is day dream
They been sleepin' on us
I'm just trynna see what they see

All I do is day dream
They been sleepin' on us
I'm just trynna see what they see

Day dream
Tryna see what they see
All I hear is an echo (echo, echo, echo)
Trynna see what they see
Keep me goin', keep me goin', keep me goin'
All I hear is an echo (echo, echo, echo)
All I hear is an echo
Day dream

Keep me goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'

Nine in the morning
Nine in the morning
Keep me goin'
Day Dream
Trynna see what they see
All I hear is an echo (echo, echo)

Uh, it's just me and my mirror
My reflection is sayin' reflect on your past
It could be clearer
My past keeps sayin' stay on this path
I couldn't be nearer
I remember my past, I couldn't get clearance

All I do is day dream
They been sleepin' on us
I'm just trynna see what they see

Keep me goin', keep me goin', keep me goin'
Keep me goin', keep me goin', keep me goin'
Keep me goin', keep me goin', goin', goin', goin'
Goin', goin', goin', goin', goin', go, go, go, go, go
Day dream

Keep me goin'
Keep me goin'
Keep me goin'

All I do is day dream
They been sleepin' on us
I'm just trynna see what they see
