[Verse: Ymir]
Luck doesn't like me
They trynna wipe me
Five stars, I'm wanted
Duck it, I'm hunted
Stole from Swarovsky
They brought the SWAT team
Check it, I'm bougee
Flash bomb, I'm blinded
Hands above my head now
Gun to my chest, ow
Eyes on my neckpiece
Skipping them heartbeats
Camos and Uzis
Bloodied and bruised me
No way to get out
Guess I'm bout to die, now

[Drop]
Run

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Ymir]
Holy hit, holy hit, yeah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we're here for fun
Holy hit, holy hit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun
Holy hit, holy hit, yeah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we're here for fun
Holy hit, holy hit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun

[Drop]

[Chorus: Ymir]
Holy hit, holy hit, yeah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we're here for fun
Holy hit, holy hit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun
Holy hit, holy hit, yeah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we're here for fun
Holy hit, holy hit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun
