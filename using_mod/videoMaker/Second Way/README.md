the difference in this way to all the previous ways is instead of using the previous image, we use the one ~10 back, instead, so hopefully it smoothes itself out. in additon, we will stay on prompts for ~20 frames.
We may, if it doesn't take 2+ hours/gen, add a way to use the original sequential code to make frames approach one singular "central" image.
