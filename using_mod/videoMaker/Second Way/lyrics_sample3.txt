[Verse 1]
I don't know how to live
Since we fell through, I dream of you
Buried deep in the feelings I hold on to
I can't let loose
I pray my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the cold, in the dirt
Where nobody can hear me cry
Bites from the frost, yeah, it hurts
Trying to lose my fuckin' mind
[Chorus]
Slowly, your ghost
Haunts me with her smile
I just smile back, admitting
I will never change

[Pre-Drop]
Never change
Never change

[Drop]
I will never change
I will never change

[Verse 2]
How do you even live?
Knowing wе're through, that will not do
If I can't have my freedom, neithеr should you
You're not immune
So why am I

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the cold, in the dirt
While you're probably doing fine?
Black from the frost, yeah, it's worse
Knowing you will never be mine
[Chorus]
Softly, your ghost
Taunts me with her lies
Buried in my own deceptions
I will never change

[Pre-Drop]
Change
I will never–

[Drop]
I will never–

[Outro]
I will never change
