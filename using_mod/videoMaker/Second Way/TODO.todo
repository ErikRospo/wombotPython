[ ] MAYBE: use a weighted average of the previous 10 images
[ ] find out how to do interframe interpolation
Archive:
  [x] generate images
  [x] use the image from ~10 back to (hopefully) smooth things out
  [x] generate video
  [x] handle edge cases
  [x] instead of changing the prompt every time, we instead use each prompt for ~20 images
    this will hopefully help with the video being too jumpy
  [x] port over settings.js to settings.json
