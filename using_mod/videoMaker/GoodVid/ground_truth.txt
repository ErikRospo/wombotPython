Only in the dark, I
See it in a true light
Baby, you could be my downfall
End of my life

Mission's not right
Maybe I don't see him, maybe I'm blind
We made a deal with the devil
But we're doing fine

I feel it all the time
The heavy weight of your love
I'd put it on the line
I would give it up

And I know
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, oh, wow
Baby, we're competin' with a sacrifice

Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial

I think it's a sure sign
We should be runnin' with the divine
Baby, we could reach the heavens
Or dance in hellfire

And if they say it's alright
I don't wanna see you, wanna stay blind
'Cause you feel like an angel
And we're doin' fine

I feel it all the time
The heavy weight of your love
I'd put it on the line
I would give it right up

And I know
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Like, oh, wow
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial like

Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial like
Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial like
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're competin' with a sacrifice

Baby, it's official, this is sacrificial
Oh, wow
Oh, wow
Baby, we're competin' with a sacrifice

Baby, we're competin' with a sacrifice
